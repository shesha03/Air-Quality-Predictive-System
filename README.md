# Air-Quality-Predictive-System
A step-by-step approach to predicting carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the air-using machine learning (ML). 

In this project, we successfully predicted CO(GT) values using various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression. By carefully selecting key environmental and chemical variables such as temperature, humidity, and benzene concentration, we were able to build models that effectively forecast carbon monoxide levels in the air.

The analysis revealed valuable insights into how several factors influence CO(GT) values. For example, the Partial Dependence and ICE plots demonstrated the magnitude of change in CO(GT) when other variables were altered, helping us understand their impact. Furthermore, correlation analysis and feature importance ranking allowed us to identify the variables that play the most significant roles in predicting carbon monoxide concentration, such as C6H6(GT) and temperature.

The combination of correlation analysis, feature importance, and standard deviation calculations provided a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the variables, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions about air quality. The visualizations, including heatmaps, sorted correlation matrices, and side-by-side comparisons, made the data relationships clearer and easier to interpret.
Overall, this project offers a robust framework for predicting CO(GT) levels and understanding how several factors affect air quality. These findings can be leveraged for future air quality monitoring and pollution control strategies, contributing to a healthier and safer environment.
